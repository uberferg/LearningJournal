    <h2>The onload Property</h2>

    <p>
    <h3><code>&lt;body onload='jscode;'&gt;</code> - </h3>
    Runs <code>jscode;</code> when the page body, and thus the
    canvas tag, has finished loading.
    This method can animate multiple canvases on the same page,
    even when they have separate animation functions in separate
    scripts. However, they must all have distinct names, and 
    cannot share any global variable names in order to work.
    </p>
  
    <p>
    <h3><code>window.onload = functionName;</code> - </h3>
    Runs <code>functionName</code> when the DOM has finished loading.
    If instead you write 
    <code>window.onload = functionName();</code> then
    to guarantee that the script works, you must load the script
    in a tag at the end of your page's body rather than in the head.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3><code>window.onload = function() { ... };</code> - </h3>
    Enclosing your entire JS script in this turns your
    whole script into a function call, and executes it
    when the DOM has finished loading.
    </p>


    <h2>Nameless function execution</h2>

    <p>
    <h3><code>(function() { ... })();</code> - </h3>
    Enclosing your entire JS script in this turns your
    whole script into a function call, making it execute
    immediately on loading. It also has the added effect of
    enclosing all your scripts objects within this function,
    isolating them from the global namespace.
    To guarantee that the script works, you must load the script
    in a tag at the end of your page's body rather than in the head.
    This method can animate multiple canvases on the same page,
    controlled by separate scripts in separate files, providing
    optimal modularity for your code. In addition, because the
    code is enclosed within a function with no name, there are no
    global variables, and the scripts will not interfere with each other.
